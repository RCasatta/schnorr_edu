# WARNING

This is an educational-only implementation of the proposed [Schnorr BIP](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) with the following features:

Note 28 October 2019: updated @ 32 bytes public key version

* Non efficient
* Non secure
* Non constant time
* A lot of heap allocation
* A lot of avoidable copy of memory
* Poor understanding of underlying math
* Lot of TODOs 

If you want to sign and verify with schnorr use [libsecp256k1]()

```
cargo test --release
```
